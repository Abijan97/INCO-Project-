            <h3>Management and information Technology</h3>
            <p>Today Department of Industrial Management is home to a diverse undergraduate student body of nearly 175, hailing from almost every District in the country. Our students thrive in a challenging academic atmosphere and enjoy the rich cultural life of the Department of Industrial Management. .</p>
            <p>BSc. MIT programme is designed to give you the skills you need to bridge the communication gap that often exists between system engineers and business managers. The distinctiveness of MIT is in the unique blend of Management and Information Technology. The undergraduates of the Department of Industrial Management work together in cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams to solve real-world case study and design problems in business engineering and systems technology while incorporating their wealth of new perspectives and experiences. Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, Database Management, Business Process Re-engineering, Strategic Management, International Trade and Export Marketing, Finance and Entrepreneurship Development are among few of the areas you will be specializing in our programme. 
            </p>
            <p>Industrial Training program is one of the highlights of our program and the culmination of the first two years of the learning experience. It enables our undergraduates to integrate and apply theories, knowledge, skills and values acquired through their first and second year in areas related to their interests and learning needs. It also provides them with the opportunity for experiential learning, linking and reflecting upon the relationship between theoretical perspectives and field experience, and an opportunity to develop competence in a range of work skills. Industrial Training allows undergraduates to develop networks and career opportunities with leading organizations providing an advantageous position to gain future full-time employment.
