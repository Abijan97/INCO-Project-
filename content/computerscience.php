            <p>The Department of Statistics & Computer Science of the University of Kelaniya was established in July 1999 with the objective of meeting the ever-increasing Statistics and Computer Science education needs of university students in particular, and the academic and industrial community in general. At present the Department of Statistics & Computer Science offers Statistics and Computer Science as subjects for the B.Sc.(General) Degree Programme and the annual intakes for these two subjects are 75 and 125 respectively. In addition, we conduct three B.Sc. Honours Degree programmes, Statistics, Computer Science and Computer Studies.</p>
              
              </p>
              <p>The Department, in collaboration with the Department of Industrial Management offers a new stream called Computer Studies (COST) to students in the Faculty of Science, Humanities and Social Sciences. The annual intake for this course is 50. At present, the Department comprises eight senior lecturers, two lecturers and three probationary lecturers. In addition, an MSc programme in Computer Science was launched in 2001. Qualified students could also register for the research degree MPhil in either Statistics or Computer Science.</p>
              </p>
              <p>The Department of Statistics & Computer Science recognizes the need for close collaboration with the industry both in teaching and research and has links with number of industrial partners who would provide both students and staff with a window onto the industrial world and a basis for real-world projects.</p>

              <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
              <p>Today Department of Industrial Management is home to a diverse undergraduate student body of nearly 175, hailing from almost every District in the country. Our students thrive in a challenging academic atmosphere and enjoy the rich cultural life of the Department of Industrial Management. .</p>
              <p>BSc. MIT programme is designed to give you the skills you need to bridge the communication gap that often exists between system engineers and business managers. The distinctiveness of MIT is in the unique blend of Management and Information Technology. The undergraduates of the Department of Industrial Management work together in cross-functional, multidisciplinary teams to solve real-world case study and design problems in business engineering and systems technology while incorporating their wealth of new perspectives and experiences. Systems Engineering, Software Engineering, Database Management, Business Process Re-engineering, Strategic Management, International Trade and Export Marketing, Finance and Entrepreneurship Development are among few of the areas you will be specializing in our programme.
              </p>
              <p>Industrial Training program is one of the highlights of our program and the culmination of the first two years of the learning experience. It enables our undergraduates to integrate and apply theories, knowledge, skills and values acquired through their first and second year in areas related to their interests and learning needs. It also provides them with the opportunity for experiential learning, linking and reflecting upon the relationship between theoretical perspectives and field experience, and an opportunity to develop competence in a range of work skills. Industrial Training allows undergraduates to develop networks and career opportunities with leading organizations providing an advantageous position to gain future full-time employment.
