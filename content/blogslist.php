              n this introductory Java programming course, you will be introduced to powerful concepts
              such as functional abstraction, the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and
              Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Examples and case studies will be provided so
              that you can implement simple programs on your own or collaborate with peers.

              Emphasis is put on immediate feedback and on having a fun experience. Programming knowledge
              is not only useful to be able to program today’s devices such as computers and smartphones.
              It also opens the door to computational thinking, i.e. the application of computing
              techniques to every-day processes.

              This Java course will provide you with a strong understanding of basic Java programming
              elements and data abstraction using problem representation and the object-oriented
              framework. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” This course will use
              sample objects such as photos or images to illustrate some important concepts to enhance
              understanding and retention. You will learn to write procedural programs using variables,
              arrays, control statements, loops, recursion, data abstraction and objects in an integrated
              development environment.
